# FileMergeSort
We have a big file with integers (only integers).<br/>
The task was to implement merge sort algorithm for that file.<br/><br/>
JVM have much less memory than size of file.<br/><br/>

	package ua.goit.alg;
		
		public class Arrays {
		public static void mergeSort(File file) {
		
		}
	}
